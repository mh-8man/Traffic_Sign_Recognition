Tested models on norwegian traffic signs (20 epochs)
CNN_Traffic_Sign accuracy : 0.2391304347826087
Test_Model accuracy : 0.17391304347826086

We think that the models are overfitted towards the zoomed in pictures in the training and test set. 
This will result in a model that has a poor judgement of signs when there is a lot of noise in the pictures.
The pictures we tried in the last run had a lot of noise in them compared to the rest of the images of german traffic signs.

Tried to take clean images of norwegian traffic signts, with no background noise to see if it would give good results on the model.
The results from this was as follows:
Test_Model.h5:  0.611111111111111
CNN_Traccic_Sign.h5:  0.5555555555555556 

Now we will make a new model, with 3 epochs to see if it gives a more accurate result
The accuracy on norwegian pictures was: 0.10869565217391304
while testing on the clean images got only: 0.5833333333333334
This was the result from the model when it had 0.925 accuracy during its last epoch.
