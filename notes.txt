Tested models on norwegian traffic signs (20 epochs)
CNN_Traffic_Sign accuracy : 0.2391304347826087
Test_Model accuracy : 0.17391304347826086

We think that the models are overfitted towards the zoomed in pictures in the training and test set. 
This will result in a model that has a poor judgement of signs when there is a lot of noise in the pictures.
The pictures we tried in the last run had a lot of noise in them compared to the rest of the images of german traffic signs.


1. hvor stor rapporten skal være?
1. Er youtube relevant resource i rapporten (CNN Tutorial)?
1. Skal vi documenter de resource (om de er blogpost eller youtube).
2. skal arbeids-oppsummering være individuelt eller gruppevis? er det 2 sider hver uke eller til sammen? 
2. hva betyr "visualiser datasettet"?(det står i oppgavebeskrivelsen)
2. hva betyr forskjellig modells? (er det nok med å bruk CNN models?)
3. skal test bildene (norsk) være zoomed-in eller ikke?
4. hva er det forventet accuracy med norsk vanlig/meta bilder?
5. er kode dokumentasjon god nok (som den er)? evt. hvor grundig må den dokumenteres? 
6. Har du noe forslag om hva vi kan teste videre, eventuelt hva kan være relevant å researche for å få et bedre resultat?


Tried to take clean images of norwegian traffic signts, with no background noise to see if it would give good results on the model.
The results from this was as follows:
Test_Model.h5:  0.611111111111111
CNN_Traccic_Sign.h5:  0.5555555555555556 

Now we will make a new model, with 3 epochs to see if it gives a more accurate result
The accuracy on norwegian pictures was: 0.10869565217391304
while testing on the clean images got only: 0.5833333333333334
This was the result from the model when it had 0.925 accuracy during its last epoch.

After the result on  norwegian images, we found out that the model is bad at generalization (the best result was 17%). After some research we tried some methods to avoid overfitting. The methods are as follows:
- Set dropout layers to 0.5
- Use of averagepooling in stead of maxpooling
- Use kernel size of 3x3(it was originally 5x5)
- Use a less trained model(less epochs)
We made the model CNN_Traffic_gen.h5 which gets an accuracy of 0.9584323040380047 with the german images.
And the accuracy on norwegian_meta_images is: 0.7777777777777778.
Accuracy on Norwegian pictures: 0.3695652173913043.
